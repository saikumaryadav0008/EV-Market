EV MARKET

Step 1 - Formulate questions based on client requirements

1.	What type of EV to produce? (2W scooter/bike, 3W passenger/cargo, 4W car/SUV, bus)
2.	Who is the customer? (individual commuter, fleet operator, government/institution)
3.	Where to launch first? (states/cities with high adoption/strong policy/infra)
4.	How to price? (align to TCO & early-market psychographics)
5.	What GTM model? (direct retail vs B2B leasing; battery-as-a-service; charging/swapping partners)

Step 2 - Collect data based on the questions

A) Market size & growth

•	All-India EV registrations (FY25): 1.97 million (+16.9% YoY); E-2W: 1.15 million (+21.2% YoY); Electric passenger vehicles >100k (+18.2% YoY). ([SIAM][1], [The Economic Times][2])

•	Rolling 12-month VAHAN view (Jun 2024–May 2025): \~2.06 million EVs, peak Oct 2024. (TS data & low-speed e-2W excluded, VAHAN basis). ([EVreporter][3])

•	Electric car (4W) trend: \~80k cars in 2023 (+70% YoY), \~2% of car sales (context of ramp). ([IEA][4])

B) Geography state concentration & adoption

•	Top state contributors (FY24–25, VAHAN basis): Uttar Pradesh 18.5%, Maharashtra 12.1%, Karnataka 8.5%* (Top 10 states ≈ 73.7% of national EV sales). ([EVreporter][5])
•	Public charging infrastructure (as of Apr 1, 2025): Counts published via BEE/PIB release (state-tier breakup annexed there). ([Press Information Bureau][6])
•	NITI Aayog (2024/2025): India EV stock ≈ 5.45 million in 2024; \~2.08 million sales in 2024; penetration still below global average-state policy & infra are key levers. ([NITI AAYOG][7])
•	Operational data source: The VAHAN dashboard provides up-to-date, state/city, fuel-type and vehicle-class drilldowns for ongoing monitoring. ([vahan.parivahan.gov.in][8])

C) Charging infrastructure & ecosystem

•	Public charging stations: Official counts & trajectory available from **BEE/Ministry of Power* (PIB note; FAME-III context). ([Press Information Bureau][6]) Sector scans also show \~12k public stations as of early 2024 (landscape reports; cross-check with BEE portal). ([Massive Foundation][9], [Bee India][10])

D) Policy & pipeline signals

•	Multiple OEMs launching 10 new EV models in 2025 (Tata, Maruti, Mahindra, BYD, Hyundai, VinFast), aligning with India’s 2030 targets and stricter 2027 norms. Signals robust supply and consumer choice expansion. ([Reuters][11])
•	Global context: EV growth continues; India trails global penetration but is accelerating policy + infra remain decisive. ([IEA][12], [IEA Blob Storage][13], [The Times of India][14])


1) Analysis (what the data says)

Where demand and feasibility intersect

•	Volume reality: E-2W & E-3W are the workhorses of India’s EV growth; they dominate unit volumes and deliver immediate TCO benefits for commuters and fleets. ([SIAM][1], [The Economic Times][2], [EVreporter][3])
•	Geographic	concentration: UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka lead by absolute contribution; Delhi and parts of Kerala/Karnataka show high penetration supported by strong state policies and urban density. ([EVreporter][5])
•	Infrastructure: Public charging is scaling from a low base; dense metro corridors and fleet depots are the most infra-ready entry nodes. ([Press Information Bureau][6], [Bee India][10])
•	4W EVs: Growing from a smaller base; affluent metros show rising acceptance as more 300–600 km range models arrive. ([Reuters][11], [IEA][4])

Early-market (Innovators/Early Adopters) hotspots

•	Delhi NCR: Policy ambition + early-adopter consumers; strong visibility for pilots.
•	Bengaluru (Karnataka): Tech-savvy commuters, high 2W base, strong startup ecosystem.
•	UP Tier-1/2 (Lucknow, Kanpur, Noida/Ghaziabad): Huge E-3W base and rising commuter segments; scale potential with B2B fleets. ([EVreporter][5])


2) Segmentation (who to target first)

1.	Segment A - Urban Individual Commuters (E-2W)

•	Customer: 20–40, office-goers/students in metros; daily 10–40 km.
•	Why now: Price parity (post-subsidy), low running cost, convenient home/office charging.
•	Where: Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Pune*; expand to Kochi, Jaipur. ([SIAM][1], [EVreporter][5])

2.	Segment B - Commercial Fleets (E-3W cargo/passenger; E-2W last-mile)

•	Customer: E-commerce/logistics (Flipkart, Amazon, BigBasket), hyperlocal delivery, e-rickshaw operators, ride-hailing partners.
•	Why now: High utilization => rapid payback; depot/route predictability eases charging/swapping.
•	Where: UP urban belt (Lucknow/Kanpur/Noida), Delhi NCR, Mumbai MMR. ([EVreporter][5])

3.	Segment C - Affluent Early Adopters (E-4W)

•	Customer: Upper-middle/high income in Tier-1 metros seeking tech/eco status.
•	Why now: New 2025 model wave, longer ranges, faster charging; premium willingness-to-pay.
•	Where: Delhi NCR, Mumbai/MMR, Bengaluru, Hyderabad*. ([Reuters][11])

4.	Segment D - Government & Institutions

•	Customer: Municipal corporations/PSUs; state procurement under EV policies/FAME.
•	Why now: Mandates + subsidies; bulk orders for buses/utility vehicles. ([Press Information Bureau][6])

3) Visualization (what to plot for your deck/report)

•	Pie: FY25 EV volumes by type (E-2W/E-3W/E-4W/Bus). (SIAM + VAHAN) ([SIAM][1], [EVreporter][3])
•	Bar: Top contributing states by EV sales share (UP, MH, KA…). (EVreporter/VAHAN) ([EVreporter][5])
•	Heatmap: Public charging density by state (BEE/PIB). ([Press Information Bureau][6])

4) Conclusion (so what?)
•	Fastest, lowest-risk entry = E-2W (scooters) for urban commuters + E-3W (cargo/passenger) for fleets. These are India’s highest-volume EV segments with the clearest TCO and policy tailwinds. ([SIAM][1], [The Economic Times][2], [EVreporter][5])
•	Launch geographies:
o	Phase 1 - Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, UP urban belt (volume + policy + infra).
o	Phase 2 - Mumbai/MMR, Pune, Hyderabad, Kochi, Jaipur (rising adoption). ([EVreporter][5], [Press Information Bureau][6])
•	Infra strategy: Blend home/office charging (E-2W), depot charging & battery swapping (E-3W fleets), and CPO partnerships using BEE station maps for coverage planning. ([Bee India][10])
